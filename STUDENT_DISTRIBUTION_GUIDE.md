# Student Distribution Guide

## 🎯 **Distribution Criteria**

Students are distributed to faculty based on these **4 criteria**:

1. **School** (e.g., ASET)
2. **Department** (e.g., Computer Science & Engineering)  
3. **Batch** (e.g., 2022-27)
4. **Section** (e.g., A, B, C)

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Admin Side:**
1. Admin creates faculty with assignments:
   - School: ASET
   - Department: Computer Science & Engineering
   - Batch: 2022-27
   - Sections: B, C
   - Subjects: Operating Systems, Computer Networks

### **Faculty Side:**
1. Faculty logs in → Sees only students matching their criteria
2. **Automatic filtering** based on:
   - Same school (ASET)
   - Same department (Computer Science & Engineering)
   - Same batch (2022-27)
   - Same sections (B, C)

## 📋 **Excel Template Structure**

Create your Excel with these columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Roll Number | Unique student ID | A2451451345431 |
| Name | Student full name | John Doe |
| Email | Student email | john.doe@aset.edu.in |
| Enrollment No. | Enrollment number | A20405222156 |
| Section | Student section | A, B, C, D, E, F |
| Department | Department name | Computer Science & Engineering |
| Batch | Academic batch | 2022-27, 2023-28, etc. |
| Semester | Current semester | 1-8 |

## 👨‍🏫 **Faculty Assignment Examples**

### **Faculty 1: Raj (raj25@gmail.com)**
- School: ASET
- Department: Computer Science & Engineering
- Batch: 2022-27
- Sections: B, C
- **Will see:** 20 students (10 from Section B + 10 from Section C)

### **Faculty 2: Dr. Smith (smith@aset.edu.in)**
- School: ASET
- Department: Computer Science & Engineering
- Batch: 2023-28
- Sections: A, B, C
- **Will see:** 30 students (10 from each section A, B, C)

### **Faculty 3: Prof. Johnson (johnson@aset.edu.in)**
- School: ASET
- Department: Computer Science & Engineering
- Batch: 2022-27, 2023-28
- Sections: A (for both batches)
- **Will see:** 20 students (10 from 2022-27 Section A + 10 from 2023-28 Section A)

## ✅ **What's Implemented**

1. **Removed advanced filters** for faculty users
2. **Auto-populated faculty assignments** display
3. **Automatic student filtering** based on faculty criteria
4. **Search functionality** within assigned students
5. **Real-time updates** when admin changes assignments

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy Firebase rules** (as mentioned earlier)
2. **Create Excel with 200 students** using the template
3. **Upload via Admin panel** → Student Management → Upload Excel
4. **Test faculty login** to see filtered students

The system will automatically distribute students to faculty based on the 4 criteria!
